# esm-mocking (aka es6-modules)
This repository contains the source code for my Dev.to article on "Mocking ES6 Modules in Jest, including mocking dependency modules".

_**Caution**: The project uses a node function that (as of June 2023) is experimental and not recommended for production code._

I subsequently came across a YouTube video from OpenJS World 2021 where David Mark Clements presented his findings from trying to [Testing EcmaScript Modules](https://youtu.be/ZdrNw7zxa5Y) for the [OpenJs Foundation](https://openjsf.org/)â€™s Certification and Training programs.
